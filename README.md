# Malware-Detection-with-Sysinternal-Suite

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to show how well the Sysinternals Suite—in particular, programs like Process Explorer and Process Monitor—may be used to identify, examine, and comprehend harmful software activity on Windows operating systems. The project's goal is to improve cybersecurity enthusiasts' and professionals' capacity to recognize questionable operations, comprehend malware behavior, and use this understanding to fortify system security defenses by employing these tools.

## Skills Learned

- Identifying suspicious processes and activities
- Using Process Explorer to analyze running processes
- Using Process Monitor to capture and analyze system activity
- Understanding malware behavior and characteristics
- Strengthening system security defenses

## Tools Used

- [Sysinternals Suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite)
  - **Process Explorer**: A powerful task manager and system monitoring tool that provides detailed information about running processes and their resource usage.
  - **Process Monitor**: A real-time monitoring tool that logs system activity, including file system, registry, and process/thread activity.

## What to Look For When Analyzing Processes for Malware

- **Processes that have no name:** Legitimate processes typically have a clear name.
- **Processes with no icon/image:** Most genuine processes have associated icons.
- **Processes with no description or company name:** Trusted software usually includes descriptions and company names.
- **Unsigned images:** Malware often lacks proper digital signatures.
- **Processes residing in the Windows directory or User profile:** System directories should primarily contain trusted system files.
- **Packed executables:** These are often used to obfuscate malware.
- **Suspicious URLs:** Look out for processes communicating with unknown or suspicious domains.
- **Processes with open TCP/IP connections:** Unusual network activity can indicate malware.
- **Suspicious DLLs or services hosted by processes:** Malware can use these to hide its activities.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Windows operating system
- Basic knowledge of Windows processes and system activities
- Familiarity with malware concepts

### Installation

1. Download the Sysinternals Suite from the [official website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite).
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded file to a preferred location on your system.

### Usage

#### Process Explorer

1. Launch Process Explorer by double-clicking `procexp.exe`.
2. Examine the list of running processes and look for any suspicious or unfamiliar processes.
3. Right-click on a suspicious process and select "Properties" to view detailed information, such as the process's path, command line, and parent process.
4. Use the "VirusTotal" integration to check the process against known malware signatures.

#### Process Monitor

1. Launch Process Monitor by double-clicking `procmon.exe`.
2. Start capturing system activity by clicking the "Capture" button or pressing `Ctrl+E`.
3. Perform tasks or run programs that might trigger suspicious activities.
4. Stop capturing activity by clicking the "Capture" button again or pressing `Ctrl+E`.
5. Use filters to narrow down the captured events and focus on potential malware behavior.
6. Analyze the events to identify any unusual or unauthorized activities, such as unexpected file modifications, registry changes, or network connections.


## Conclusion

By using the Sysinternals Suite, particularly Process Explorer and Process Monitor, this project demonstrates effective methods for identifying and analyzing malware activities on Windows systems. These tools empower cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals to enhance their ability to detect malicious behavior and strengthen system security defenses.
